### Strategy Input parameters 

**Following is code snippet to define a input parameter for your strategy:**

[Parameter("FastLengthPeriod", Description = "The fast length of the EMA", DefaultValue = 12)]
private int _fastLengthPeriod = 5;

There can be any number of inputs define for strategy and used to change the state of strategy instance while running a backtesting. Any variable decorated by attribute Parameter is tagged as input parameter by system

As compared to Indicator template there is no concept of Output parameter and only order signal generated from strategy is the main return type during incremental backtesting process from a method ProcessStrategy

#### Initialze  method 

The initialize method is called once prior to running the strategy and used to set properties and initialize indicator that are used during backtesting evaluation process.
Following code snippet initialize the two EMA Indicator instances
 protected override void Initialize()
  {
            // Initialize the indicator object
            _slowEMAIndicator = GetIndicator("EMA);
            _fastEMAIndicator = GetIndicator ("EMA");
 }

The GetIndicator creates instance of EMA indicator with default main TimeDataSeries used in backtesting.

#### OnStateChanged  method

The OnStateChanged method is called with change in state of strategy instance. The strategy inastance is undergoing various state change and OnStateChanged method allows to initialize and reset some variables depending on the logic.
protected override void OnStateChanged()
{
            if (StrategyState == StrategyState.ActiveMode)
            {
                // Change the indicator input based on user specified input signal settings
                _slowEMAIndicator.SetFieldValue("LengthPeriod", _slowLengthPeriod);
                 _fastEMAIndicator.SetFieldValue("LengthPeriod", _fastLengthPeriod);
            }
}


**Following are the different state:**
|  |  |
| :--- | :--- |
| ConfigureMode	| This is initial state before a backtesting starts. |
| ActiveMode | This is state just before a backtesting starts. Here we usually set any indicator user specified input value. |
| HistoricalMode | This is state if process is undergoing a backtesting on historical data. |
| RealtimeMode | This is state after backtesting, in case system is attached with realtime data. |
| TerminateMode | This is state when strategy instance is terminating. |

There is important properties that is useful in case of system is setup for realtime mode and is called CalculationMode 
It has two options:
|  |  |
| :--- | :--- |
| OnBarClose | The method ProcessStrategy is called only on Bar close event and it is a default behaviour. |
| OnEachTick | The method ProcessStrategy is called on each LTP change which may change the High, Low, Close of a current developing bar. The indicator value change during a developing bar process. This mode is only valid when trading system is attached to realtime data stream otherwise system behave like OnBarClose mode as default or fallback. |

```
protected override void OnStateChanged()
{
            if (StrategyState == StrategyState.ConfigureMode)
            {
                CalculationMode = CalculationMode.OnEachTick;
            }
}
```

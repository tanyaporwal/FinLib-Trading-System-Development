### Creating Your First Trading Strategies

A strategy is a collection of logic or rules that may use many indicators or price actions to determine when to buy and when to sell some instruments. A strategy can typically be run against historical data (backtested) or run against live data to execute real-time trades. There are many indicators packaged with QX.FinLib and any proprietary custom indicators can be easily build. Weâ€™ll be walking through Strategy creation which could theoretically use any Indicator to perform buys and sells.


The building block of any basic trading strategies used to analyze and backtest are:

**Historical Data:** The historical data of given financial asset is mainly represented the past price events in the form of OHLCV bar of specific  time frame compression  i.e. 5 minutes, 1 hours etc. The historical data exist with you in either csv format or fetched from data provider using their APIs or stored in any database repository. 

This data must be represented or converted to TimeDataSeries object
The asset class is represented by object InstrumentBase of types Equity, Futures, Options etc

**The strategy model:** The strategy model is a rule based system that generates signals for entering and exit from trade. This is represented by your own .NET based class that must inherit from QX.FinLib.TS.Strategy.StrategyBase and implements some override method and logics specific to signal generation.

**The strategy Configuration or Settings:** The backtesting process of your strategy needs some setup to define for example initial capital, any commission or adjustment of Slippages per trade etc.

Following are example of setting some strategy configuration details

StrategyConfigData strategyConfigData = new StrategyConfigData();
strategyConfigData.InitialCapital = 500000;

strategyConfigData.Pyramiding = PyramidingType.Disallow;
strategyConfigData.MaxPyramidingPosition = 1;

strategyConfigData.ContractMultiplier = 1;
strategyConfigData.StopLossTriggerPoint = StopLossTriggerPoint.High_Low_Bar;
strategyConfigData.OrderExecutionAt = OrderExecution.CurrentBar_Close;

Following are the StrategyConfigData properties:
| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| InitialCapital |  |
| FilledOrderCommission |  |
| CancelOrderCommission |  |
| LimitOrderSlippage |  |
| MarketOrderSlippage |  |	
| CommissionType | Per_Contract, Per_Transaction, Percentage |
| StopLossTriggerPoint |  |
| SlippageType | Per_Contract, Per_Transaction, Percentage |
| SlippagePercentage |  |
| OrderExecutionAt | NextBar_Open, CurrentBar_Close |
| Pyramiding |   |
| MaxPyramidingPosition	|   |
| ContractMultiplier |   |
| UserID |  |
| StrategyName |   |
| PositionSizerType	| FixedSize, InitialCapitalSize, FixedDollar, TradePercentageOfAccountBalance, RiskPercentageOfAccountBalace, Custom |
| PositionSize	|   |

**Following framework DLL references are needed for strategy development code:**

using QX.FinLib.Data;
using QX.FinLib.Data.TI;
using QX.FinLib.TS.Strategy; 

Dll libraries are added by clicking the References button in the Source code tab.

Then you create your class named with Strategy and inherit it from StrategyBase class

All trading strategy class has following basic template
```

using QX.FinLib.Data;
using QX.FinLib.Data.TI;

using QX.FinLib.TS.Strategy;

namespace QX.Strategies
{
    [StrategyAttribute("{B9650BDC-74EB-451E-A05E-2BF7056A2BFA}", "EMAStrategy", "Exponential Moving Average Strategy", "QXT")]
    public class EMAStrategy : StrategyBase
    {
        [Parameter("FastLengthPeriod", Description = "The fast length of the EMA", DefaultValue = 12)]
        private int _fastLengthPeriod = 5;

        [Parameter("SlowLengthPeriod", Description = "The slow length of the EMA", DefaultValue = 15)]
        private int _slowLengthPeriod = 12;

        private IndicatorBase _slowEMAIndicator;
        private IndicatorBase _fastEMAIndicator;

        public EMAStrategy()
        {

        }
        protected override void Initialize()
        {
            // Initialize the indicator object
            _slowEMAIndicator = GetIndicator("EMA);
            _fastEMAIndicator = GetIndicator ("EMA");
        }

        protected override void OnStateChanged()
        {
            if (StrategyState == StrategyState.ActiveMode)
            {
               // Change the indicator input based on user specified input signal settings
                _slowEMAIndicator.SetFieldValue("LengthPeriod", _slowLengthPeriod);
                _fastEMAIndicator.SetFieldValue("LengthPeriod", _fastLengthPeriod);
            }
        }

        public override void ProcessStrategy()
        {
            int contractSize = 1;

            if (CurrentIndex < _slowLengthPeriod)
                return;

            CrossOver crossover = CrossOver.None;
            crossover = _fastEMAIndicator["EMA"].Cross(_slowEMAIndicator["EMA", CurrentIndex]);

            if (crossover == CrossOver.Above)
            {
                EnterLongAtMarket(contractSize, "EnterLong");
            }
            else if (crossover == CrossOver.Below)
            {
                EnterShortAtMarket(contractSize, "EnterShort");
            }            
        }

        public override void OnMarketData(IMarketDepth marketDepth)
        {
            // For real time events
        }

        public override void OnPositionChange(int marketPosition)
        {

        }
    }
}
```
The Strategy class must be inherited from a framework provided StrategyBase class and it provides various override method
